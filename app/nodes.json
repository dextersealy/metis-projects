Throughout the 6th, 7th, and 8th floors, residents have exclusive access to 22,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor health, wellness, social, and entertainment amenity spaces. These amenities, together with an extensive range of concierge and lifestyle services, offer residents an experience found only in world-class hotels and resorts. On the southern side of the 6th floor the first of the building's two terraces is outfitted with grills, cafe seating, and dining cabanas with picnic tables. From this terrace residents will enjoy stunning views of Cass Gilbert's classic Woolworth building. The adjacent game room is outfitted with custom designed seating by Gehry. On the 7th floor a 50-foot pool is set within a skylit space surrounded by a series of glass doors that retract fully, creating a seamless integration with the building's wraparound sundeck. Overlooking City Hall Park to the north, a large drawing room with multiple seating areas and a grand piano is located adjacent to a private dining room. Both are available for private events that can be served from a chef's demonstration and catering kitchen. A 3,300 square foot state-of-the-art fitness center with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge and a spa treatment suite are also located on the 7th floor. The 8th floor offers group fitness, Boxing Studio, and private training studios, a Library with a well-curated selection of books and periodicals, a Tween's Den, a Children's Playroom, and a Screening Room with Gehry-designed amphitheatre seating that can be reserved for private events. Apartment Features: Gehry's design resulted in over 200 unique floor plans that bring the drama of the dynamic exterior wall movement into residents' private spaces. In the places where the facade undulates, the residential windows also move out into space into the apex of the folds creating free-form bay windows that are fitted with seating or left open to accommodate uniquely shaped dining or reading niches. All interior finishes and fixtures have been selected by Gehry, including cabinetry crafted in his signature honey-colored vertical grain Douglas Fir.
