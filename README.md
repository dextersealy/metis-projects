Using linear regression to predict world-wide box office gross

This repository contains the workbooks and presentation for the second
project in Metis' Data Science program. The assignment was to use
linear regression to interpret, explain or make predictions with data.

I chose to predict a movie's world-wide box office gross using only
data that's available before its release. See [this blog
post](http://www.dextersealy.com/Project2) for more information.
